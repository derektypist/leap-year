# Leap Year

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year), a leap year is a year with an extra day (February 29).  It has 366 days instead of 365 days.  These extra days occur when the year is divisible by 4 (except for years divisible by 100, but not by 400).  For example, 2020 is a leap year, but 1900 is not a leap year.  The aim is to implement this using HTML Forms and JavaScript.
